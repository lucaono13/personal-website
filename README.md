Personal Website created for a Project in Web Development class at Oregon State University.

Not currently hosted, but am working towards that soon.

Features of website:
  * 1 homepage + 4 subpages
    * Subpage 1: Board Game Geek Info grabber and downloader using BoardGameGeek's XMLAPI2 https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2
    * Subpage 2: Personal projects that are hosted on Github (can download resume from site as well)
    * Subpage 3: Football Manager Save trackers
    * Subpage 4: Simple About page
  * Will be updating/adding more features and improving UI after hosting
  * Fonts used in project will be changed to ensure that they are complying with their own licenses if needed.
